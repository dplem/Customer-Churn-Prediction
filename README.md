Capstone Project 3

### Problem Statement:

Using the comments a dataset of telecom customers, can we predict whether a customer is likely to churn?

### Background:

Customer churn is a method used to describe the loss of customers by a company. A customer has churned if they stop using the services of a company for a certain amount of time. This time frame largely depends on what products or services a company offers. Customer churn can also be referred to as attrition.
